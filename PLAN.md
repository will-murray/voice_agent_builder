# Voice Agent v1 — Implementation Plan

Companion to the Agent Specification in `CLAUDE.md`. The spec defines *what* v1 is; this plan defines *how and in what order* it gets built across the three repos (`voice_agent_builder`, `cortex-hypervisor`, `big-query-ingestion`).

Phases are sequenced by dependency. Tasks within a phase can usually run in parallel.

---

## Phase 0 — Schema & verification ✅ DONE

- **0.1** ✅ `Users.agent_script_sections` created (migration `004_voice_agent_v1_tables.sql`).
- **0.2** ✅ `Users.voice_agent_tickets` created (same migration).
- **0.3** ✅ `Blueprint_PHI.ClientDemographics` carries `_clinic_id` (underscore prefix — ETL tag).
- **0.4** ✅ `ClinicData.faq.voice_assistant` populated (0 NULLs, 58 TRUE / 2123 FALSE out of 2181 rows).

---

## Phase 1 — Compiler migration (big-query-ingestion) ✅ IMPLEMENTED, NOT YET RUN

- **1.1** ✅ Rewrote `app/transcript_analysis/agent_script.py`:
  - Claude now returns JSON with four keys (`scope_of_practice`, `not_offered`, `callers_needs`, `protocols`).
  - `_load_current_sections` reads the latest row per section, any state (draft or approved).
  - `_append_sections` writes four `draft` rows per run, `source = "compiler"`.
  - No longer writes to `Users.agent_script`. Legacy table preserved as archive.
- **1.2** ✅ Added `app/transcript_analysis/backfill_agent_script_sections.py`:
  - One-shot CLI: reads latest blob per clinic from `Users.agent_script`, asks Claude to split into four sections, writes four `draft` rows with `source = "backfill"`.
  - Idempotent (skips clinics that already have rows in the new table; `--force` to override).
  - `--dry-run` and `--clinic-id <uuid>` flags supported.

**Not yet done:** run the backfill (requires Anthropic API call + BQ writes) and run the new compiler end-to-end against a real clinic. Both should happen before Phase 3 activates in production.

---

## Phase 2 — Hypervisor endpoints (cortex-hypervisor) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **2.1** ✅ `POST /blueprint/{clinic_id}/patient/match` (in `api/routers/blueprint.py`) — mandatory `WHERE _clinic_id = @clinic_id` filter, case-insensitive name match, last4-phone match across mobile/home/work, optional DOB tie-breaker. Returns `{status, patient_id?, candidates_count}`. No PHI leaks back to caller beyond opaque `patient_id`.
- **2.2** ✅ `POST /clinics/{clinic_id}/voice_agent/tickets` (in `api/routers/voice_agent.py`) — VAPI-authed, appends one row to `Users.voice_agent_tickets` with status='open'. Details dict serialized to JSON STRING.
- **2.3** ✅ `api/routers/agent_script.py`:
  - `GET /clinics/{clinic_id}/agent_script/sections` — returns latest draft + latest approved per section, plus `all_approved` bool.
  - `POST /clinics/{clinic_id}/agent_script/sections/{section_name}/approve` — takes a `section_id`, appends a new `approved` row with content copied verbatim, `approved_by` = caller's Firebase email, source='manual'.
  - Gated on Firebase `require_read_access` / `require_write_access`.
- **2.4** ✅ Activate endpoint updated with hard gate via `services/script_approval.require_full_approval(clinic_id)` — raises 409 listing missing sections when not all 4 approved.
- **2.5** ✅ Old `POST /blueprint/{clinic_id}/patient/lookup` endpoint left in place (retires in Phase 4.1).

**Not yet done:**
- ✅ **PHI-critical test landed** — `test_patient_match_phi_isolation.py` (10 passing tests) enforces: `_clinic_id = @clinic_id` filter is always in the SQL; clinic_id is sourced from path, not body; cross-clinic lookups return `unmatched`; ambiguous matches never leak a `patient_id`; last4 validation runs before any BQ query.
- Manual smoke tests of the approval flow + ticket submission (requires backfilled clinics + sign-in).
- Minor code smell: `voice_agent.py` imports `verify_vapi_secret` from `blueprint.py` — consider moving to `api/deps.py` or a shared module to avoid cross-router coupling.

---

## Phase 3 — Voice agent rewrite (voice_agent_builder) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **3.1** ✅ `tools/blueprint.py` — full rewrite. Now exposes `make_match_patient_tool(clinic_id)` → `/blueprint/{clinic_id}/patient/match` and `make_submit_ticket_tool(clinic_id)` → `/clinics/{clinic_id}/voice_agent/tickets`. `make_voice_agent_v1_tools()` returns both. The old three tools (`lookup`, `availability`, `appointment`) are gone.
- **3.2** ✅ `agent_factory.py` — full rewrite:
  - `build_system_prompt(clinic, faqs, script_sections, pms_type)` assembles: clinic name/address/hours → four script sections (as authoritative "Script" block) → patient-identification flow (branches on `pms_type == "blueprint"`) → "submit_ticket before hanging up" instruction → FAQs as reference-only appendix → behaviour guidelines. The precedence rule ("FAQ conflicts → script wins") is stated in the prompt.
  - `_build_tools(pms_type, clinic_id)` returns `[match, submit_ticket]` for Blueprint clinics and `[submit_ticket]` otherwise (non-Blueprint clinics still get info-collection + ticket).
  - `build_agent_config(clinic, faqs, script_sections)` — `appt_types` parameter dropped entirely.
- **3.3** ✅ `create_agent.py`:
  - `fetch_appt_types` removed.
  - `fetch_faqs(clinic_id)` now filters on `voice_assistant = TRUE`.
  - `fetch_script_sections(clinic_id)` added — returns latest approved row per section; raises `ValueError` if any of the four is missing (client-side guard mirroring the hypervisor's authoritative gate).
  - `sync_assistant(clinic_name)` fetches clinic → script sections (raises on gap) → FAQs → builds config → syncs VAPI assistant.
- **3.4** ✅ Deleted `tools/acuity_scheduling.py` and `auth.py`.
- **3.5** ✅ Superseded — provisioning orchestration already lives in cortex-hypervisor (`services/provisioning.py`, `services/vapi_provisioner.py`, `services/twilio_client.py`). No duplicate modules in voice_agent_builder.

**Not yet done:**
- End-to-end smoke test: pick a clinic with all four approved sections, run `python create_agent.py` (with clinic_name edited to the target), and verify the VAPI assistant gets created with the new prompt + two tools.
- Update the `CORTEX_API_BASE_URL` env var when agents are created for prod (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`).

---

## Phase 4 — Cleanup

Depends on Phase 3 being live across all production clinics.

- **4.1** Drop the old `POST /blueprint/{clinic_id}/patient/lookup` endpoint.
- **4.2** Retire the legacy `Users.agent_script` table (drop, or convert to a view over `Users.agent_script_sections`).

---

## Phase 5 — Frontend dashboard (partial — Scripts tab landed)

Section editing + approval UI via `/dashboard/manage/[instanceId]` → **Scripts** tab. Surface is live; other frontend work (voice agent status, clinic-side activation, etc.) is still part of the broader dashboard rework.

- ✅ `src/app/dashboard/manage/[instanceId]/tabs/ScriptsTab.tsx` — per-clinic expandable cards, four textarea editors per clinic (one per section), two action buttons per editor (**Save as draft** / **Approve**). Status badge + metadata captions per section.
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/instances/[id]/agent_script_sections` — returns latest draft + latest approved row per section for every clinic in the instance, plus `all_approved` bool.
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/clinics/[id]/agent_script/sections/[sectionName]` — writes a new row with `{content, state}`; `state='approved'` sets `approved_by` (Firebase email) + `approved_at`; `source='manual'` on all rows written from the dashboard.
- ✅ Access-controlled via existing `requireInstanceAccess` helper (admin of the clinic's instance, or super_admin).
- Type-checks clean; pre-existing `useSearchParams`/Suspense issue on `/dashboard/admin` is unrelated.

---

## Phase 6 — Per-clinic capabilities (configurable tool/protocol bundles) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The shape the user landed on: two feeds into the agent prompt.
  1. **Knowledge Base** — clinic-specific, compiled via transcripts (Phases 1 + 5).
  2. **Booking Protocols** — composed from per-clinic *capabilities*, each
     bundling a VAPI tool + prompt fragment + PMS compatibility requirement.
     Capabilities are toggled by admins in the dashboard.

Multi-PMS abstraction: each `Capability` subclass carries a `supported_pms`
tuple, and `to_vapi_tool()` branches on `self.pms_type` to pick the right
URL. The hypervisor keeps its existing PMS-specific routers (`/blueprint/*`,
future `/audit_data/*`); no generic dispatch layer. PHI isolation tests on
`/blueprint/patient/match` remain valid (URL unchanged).

- **6.1** ✅ Migration `005_clinic_voice_agent_capabilities.sql` —
  mutable `Users.clinic_voice_agent_capabilities (clinic_id, capability_id,
  enabled, config, updated_at, updated_by)`. PK at app layer. Backfill flips
  `patient_match` + `search_availability` on for every existing `pms_type='blueprint'`
  clinic to preserve prior behavior.
- **6.2** ✅ `voice_agent_builder/capabilities.py` — `Capability` base class,
  `SubmitTicket` (always-on, PMS-agnostic), `PatientMatch` and
  `SearchAvailability` (Blueprint-only). Each `__init__` binds clinic context
  + VAPI credential ID and validates PMS support. Tool JSON + prompt fragment
  live on the class. `tools/blueprint.py` deleted.
- **6.3** ✅ `agent_factory.build_agent_config(clinic, faqs, script_sections,
  enabled_capability_ids)` — instantiates capabilities in registry order
  (toggleable first, always-on last), composes tools + prompt fragments.
  Booking Protocols layout: toggleable fragments → static Information Capture →
  always-on fragments (Closing & Ticket Submission).
- **6.4** ✅ `create_agent.fetch_enabled_capabilities(clinic_id)` reads BQ,
  filters against `CAPABILITY_REGISTRY`. `sync_assistant` passes the list in.
- **6.5** ✅ Hypervisor: `services/voice_agent_capabilities.py` mirrors the
  metadata (3 fields per cap; documented as must-stay-in-sync). `voice_agent.py`
  router gains `GET /clinics/{id}/voice_agent/capabilities` and
  `PUT /clinics/{id}/voice_agent/capabilities/{capability_id}`. PUT uses BQ
  MERGE for upsert; validates `supported_pms` against clinic's `pms_type`;
  refuses always-on toggles; gates on `require_write_access`.
- **6.6** ✅ Dashboard: new **Voice Agent** tab in `/dashboard/manage/[instanceId]`.
  `VoiceAgentTab.tsx` renders one card per clinic with toggle switches.
  Capabilities whose `supported_pms` doesn't include the clinic's `pms_type`
  appear disabled with a "Requires: ..." badge. API routes:
  - `GET /api/admin/instances/[id]/voice_agent_capabilities` — aggregated list
  - `PUT /api/admin/clinics/[id]/voice_agent/capabilities/[capabilityId]` — toggle
  `src/lib/voice_agent_capabilities.ts` is the third mirror (the must-stay-in-sync
  list from Python lives here too).

**Three copies of capability metadata** — `voice_agent_builder/capabilities.py`
(canonical), `cortex-hypervisor/services/voice_agent_capabilities.py`,
`cortex/src/lib/voice_agent_capabilities.ts`. Tolerable because:
  - the metadata is 3 fields × few capabilities,
  - each service has distinct consumers (tool build / toggle validation /
    dashboard render) and can't share code easily,
  - drift is immediately visible (enable a cap → if mirrors disagree, the tool
    won't appear or the toggle will 400).

**Audit Data Manage path** (when it lands): create `api/routers/audit_data.py`
on the hypervisor with equivalent endpoints; extend each capability's
`supported_pms` to include `"audit_data"`; extend `_tool_url` to branch. No
changes to the dashboard or the capability toggle schema.

## Cross-cutting notes

- **Rollout**: the 4-of-4 gate means every clinic with an active agent today must have its compiled script backfilled and super-admin-approved *before* Phase 3 deploy — otherwise `sync_assistant` refuses and the agent can't be updated. Complete 1.2 and mass-approve before rolling Phase 3 out.
- **PHI tests**: the clinic_id filter on `/blueprint/{clinic_id}/patient/match` is PHI-critical. At least one test must prove cross-clinic leakage is impossible.
- **Risk ranking**: Phase 2 is highest-risk (new PHI-touching endpoints). Phase 3 is most disruptive (live agent behavior change). Phases 0, 1, 4 are low-risk.
- **Deferred from v1** (see spec's "Out of Scope" section): emergency call handling, recording-consent disclosure, after-hours vs. overflow differentiation, multi-language, ticket notification surface, instance-level shared data.
